We would likewise incline toward areas as near mumbai ,pune,delhi  cirle as could be allowed, accepting that initial two conditions are met. 


#### We will utilize our data science forces to create a couple of most promissing neighborhoods dependent on this criteria. Focal points of every territory will at that point be obviously communicated with the goal that most ideal last area can be picked. With the help of Data science we can do the analysis part very easily without spending lots of money.

### DATA:

#### Based on light of the meaning of our concern, factors that will impact our decisions are:

#### For better growth in the industries the analysis is very important ,with the help of capston how can we implement the data science effective maner is the main focus , ANnalysis parameters are thne cities and the growth factor with respect to them .
#### These factor not only going to help in analysis but also it will help in the begigng the new start up.With analysis and evealuation.
